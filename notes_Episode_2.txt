1)
Package.json is configuration for npm( package manager)
need --> to manage version of all packages/dependencies which we will download for our project

2)
Most imp package (also known as bundler) in every project --> bundler(parcel , veet , webpack)
--> we will use parcel-->they all do same kind of work ,
internal algo can be different .
need of bundler--> To develope good code ,to clean , compress our code and to push app on production 
initially our code is skeleton ---> parcel will give muscles and strength to it
command to install parcel --> npm install -D parcel
what is -D --> there are 2 types dependecies which we can install , 1) development dependecies 
 , 2)normal dependecies
dev -- > requried for development phase
normal --> requried for production phase
package will be downloaded from npm (remote database)

3)
After downloading this file you can see , this statement in "package.json" file 
"parcel": "^2.12.0"  --> so this ^ symbol means caret which means that it will
 update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version. 
 ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.

 "parcel": "~2.12.0" --> this ~ symbol means tindel  which means that it will
 update you to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version.
  ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.

4)
Difference btwn package-lock.json and package.json
packagelock.json --> keeps track of exact version of package that is installed
package.json ---> keeps track of approximate version of package

5)
what is node modules
It's like a database which has all the code of dependencies , where all packages exists which
we nedd -> i.e. parcel -->its dependencies -->its dependencies ->its dependencies .... thats 
why there are lots of packages in node modules
of packages in node modules

each package have its denepndencies mentioned inside its package.json , so there is
1 package.json per package

6)
Why there is no need to put node_modules on github?
Ans is , coz with the help of package.json and  packagelock.json we can recreate all the node modules
coz they have exact version of all dependencies which are needed , so it answers our another question 
which is , yes there is need to put package.json and  packagelock.json on github.
node_modules can be created automatically as you run the command 
npm i -D parcel

7)
We have installed recat and react-dom in node module using following commands
npm i/install react
npm i/install react-dom
--> as react and reactdom installed there is no need of external cdn commands which 
have written inside our index.html file (inside of script tag)

8)
npx package_name file_name -->this command execute package for the given source file ,
and creates the local host to run our file --> ERROR 1) localhost is created and showing error in console that , react not defined
reason of error --> coz we have removed script tag which has external  CDN links , and downloaded the 
react in node_modules , so now we have to import that by using --> import React as "react"
ERROR 2) Now it will show scr is not browser supported 
so reason for this error is in our index file we have given src = "app.js" , 
so parcel considering this as a normal js file , but its not a normal js file 
so have to add there as a type = "module" , now there is no error.

9)
What parcel does ?
1.dev buildIt creates local server to run files'
2.HMR -> Hot module replacement 
3.parcel uses file matching algo , which is written in cpp
4.It uses caching --> for faster build 
5.Image optimization --> uses some existing libraries
6.Minification(Make clean code) of files for push it to production
7.consistent hashing
8.code spliting
9.Difeerntial building --> to support differnt older versions of different browser
10.Parsel gives nice error view for developers in console
11.Better error handling suggestion
12.Gives feature to run app on HTTPs
13.Tree shaking algo -->will remove all unwanted code
14.Creates different dev and production bundles

AND MANY MORE THINGS............This is a reason of statement , PARCEL IS BEAST

10)
Explanation for line 83
npx parcel build index.html --> this will make files ready for production and store compressed and 
cleaned  files inside dist folder. , dist folder is also regenerated at moment
-->initially this will throw an error , coz we are giving entry point as index.html 
and package.json considering as app.js , so there is conflict so we have to remove that line from file 

11)
.cache , node_modules and dist folder can be regenerated , they are temp folders
coz at every stage this folders can be created , by package.json and packagelock.json 
.cache file use to reduce build time of project

12)
The list of supported browser should be given by developers , and the code for it 
is mentioned inside the package.json file 


*---*---*---* Commands learned in Episode 2 *---*---*---*

1.npm init --> To initialize a folder with npm
2.npm install -D parcel
3.npm i/install react
4.npm i/install react-dom
5.npx parcel index.html (npx package_name file_name)
6.npx parcel build index.html --if there is error after this command --> npm uninstall cssnano ,  npm i -D cssnano@4.1.11
-->last command is used to make our project production ready , all cleaned and compressed code kept in .dist folder

                            Notes of Episode no : 3 

JS engine understands , or browser understands EC6 , ECMASCRIPT6 language

const jsxheading = <h1>welocome to world of react using JSX</h1>;
//this is not a proper valid JS, error is there in console
//thisis working bcoz of parcel
//how? 
jsx code --> transpiled(this code is converted to code which browser and react can understand)-->reached to JS engine
//transpling is done by parcel , but parcel does not do this by its own , it is done by 
//package known as Babel

// React.createElement ==> ReactElement (JS object) ==> HTMLElement(render)
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id : "heading" , xyz : "abc"} , "Welcome to world of react");

JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement (JS object) ==> HTMLElement(render)
const jsxheading = <h1>welocome to world of react using JSX</h1>;

const jsxheading = <h1 className="a" tabIndex="3">welocome to world of react using JSX</h1>;
This is written in single line but what if we have to write this in multiple line , then we have to use
curley braces
ex : const jsxheading = {<h1 className="a" tabIndex="3">welocome to world of react using JSX</h1>};

There are Two ways to write React Component.
1.class based Component --old way
2.functional based Component --latest way
We will learn latest way
A normal JS function that returns a jsx code is known as FBC
synatx 1 :
const Headingcomponent = () => {
     return <h1>welcome to namste react !!</h1>;  // better option
 };

 Here return keyword is important , it plays an crucial role.

synatx 2 :
const Headingcomponent = () => { <h1>welcome to namste react !!</h1>;};

synatx 3 :
const Headingcomponent = () => <h1>welcome to namste react !!</h1>;

NOTE:
reactcomponent varaible name should start with capital letter , otherwise it will throw an error.

How to render an reactcomponent ?
syntax : root.render(Rreactcomponent/>);

What is component composition?
composing more than 1 component inside a component.

We can put/write anything (JS code , mathematical functions etc)inside a reactcomponent using curley braces { } , and at anywhere

We can put element inside function , or function inside element , 
or function inside function 
just dont write condition which will lead to an infinite loop

suppose we get data through API 
ex: const data = api.getdata();
and if this aapi contains , malicious data , then attacker can get access to our js code and he can 
manupulate our app ...this types of attackes known as -->
But JSX doesnt process data blindly injected in reactcomponent , it santisizes our data and then 
process that data
